            <p>
              Ashkan is currently working on problems related to the newly introduced concept called <b>"Fog Computing"</b>. He is interested in fundamental problems related to the fog computing. In other words, problems dealing with architectural design of fog networks, benefit and cost trade-offs in fog, interaction of fog and cloud, resource allocation in fog, etc. 
                <br/>Here is some info about fog computing.
            </p>
              <h5>Fog Computing</h5>
            <blockquote>
              Fog is a system-level horizontal architecture that distributes resources and services of computing, storage, control and networking functions closer to user, anywhere along the continuum from Cloud to Things. <a href="https://www.openfogconsortium.org" target="_blank">[Reference]</a>
            </blockquote>
            <br>
            <h5>Why Fog Computing?</h5>
            <p>The Internet of Things (IoT) is likely to be incorporated into our daily life, in areas such as transportation, healthcare, industrial automation, smart home, and emergency response. The IoT enables things to see and sense the environment, to make coordinated decisions, and to perform tasks based on these observations. Fog computing is an intelligent layer sitting between cloud and IoT, that brings low latency, location awareness, and wide-spread geographical distribution for the IoT. Inheriting main concepts of cloud computing, fog provides computation, storage, and networking services to end- users, but at the edge of the network.</p>
            <p>With the Internet of Things (IoT) becoming a major component of our daily life, understanding how IoT is implemented is becoming a challenging problem. Currently most interaction between the IoT devices and the supporting back-end servers is done through large scale cloud data centers. However, with the exponential growth of IoT devices and the amount of data they produce, communication between “things” and cloud will be costly, inefficient, and in some cases infeasible. Fog computing serves as solution for this as it provides computation, storage, and networking resource for IoT, closer to things and users. One of the promising advantages of fog is reducing service delay for end user applications, whereas cloud provides extensive computation and storage capacity with a higher latency. The other advantage of fog is saving network bandwidth, when a significant portion of the processing, storage and networking can be handled close to the edge devices. Fog also improves scalability, security, and agility.</p>

              <p>More information about fog can also be found here: <a href="https://www.openfogconsortium.org/resources/#definition-of-fog-computing" target="_blank">OpenFog Consortium definition of fog</a></p>
